# Shell Kit

ShellKit is an open-source, Python-based framework designed specifically for rapid development, testing, and automation of web application exploits. Built with the needs of security researchers, penetration testers, and CTF enthusiasts in mind, ShellKit provides a powerful set of tools focused on exploiting common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, RCE (Remote Code Execution), file inclusion, and command injection. With ShellKit, you can easily craft and test exploits, interact with vulnerable web services, automate attack vectors, and deploy payloads across a wide range of web application vulnerabilities. repository containing the exploits the AWAE course (OSWE by Offsec) helps security engineers learn.

### Key Features

* **HTTP Request & Response Handling:** Send custom HTTP requests (GET, POST) and parse responses, including headers, cookies, and body data.
* **Automated Exploits:** Easily automate web vulnerability exploitation, fuzz input fields, and test for issues like SQLi, XSS, and RCE.
* **Web Shells & Reverse Shells:** Generate reverse shell payloads and interact with web shells for remote code execution, giving you complete control over the target system.
* **Fuzzing Tools:** Send multiple payloads to web endpoints with minimal setup and get immediate feedback on successful exploits.
* **Cross-Platform Payloads:** Generate platform-specific shellcode and reverse shells, allowing exploitation across various environments.
* **Payload Chaining:**s Combine exploits to create more sophisticated attack chains, bypassing multiple layers of security protections.

## Why Shellkit

ShellKit was created by hackers for hackers. Its goal is to make exploit development and web application exploitation as seamless and efficient as possible. Whether you're cracking open a vulnerable web app in a CTF competition, automating penetration testing tasks, or diving into web security research, ShellKit is your ultimate tool for fast, effective exploitation. Ready to break into those web apps? ShellKit is here to make your exploits as efficient as possible!
